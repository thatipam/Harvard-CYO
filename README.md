This project analyzed the statistical properties of COVID-19 data of Germany available on Kaggle.
The data is for 225 days.
na values are cleaned.
At the outset, Data properties are studied and its trends are analyzed using several visualization techniques namely scatterplots, bar charts, graphs etc
To start with linear models are used, smoothing techniques are adopted and progression is made towards non-linear regression.
In total, lm function, bin smoothing, loess smoothing, k-smoothing, polynomial regression, knn cross validation, decision trees, and random forest models are applied.
Data is partitioned to train (80%) and test data (20%).
It is observed that RMSE is decreased considerably and accuracy of prediction is improved significantly as I progressed with the above approaches in succession. Supporting plots and statistical numbers are provided to prove this deduction.
